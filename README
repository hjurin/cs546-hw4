This repository contains all the source code for HW4.
It also contains all tests and tests results.
All files are described at the bottom of this README.

# BUILD AND RUN

Only use the given makefiles:
make cg CLASS=C
make mg CLASS=C

# LAUNCH TESTS

Tests should have the right execution rights, if not, just tap
    chmod +x *.3
These test simply launch the solution over different sized chunks (size 1000 to size 30000 with step 500)
and store their result elapsed times in elapsed_times.csv. In order to do that, print_result() has been modified.

# FILES

* test_plotting.ipynb       Contains the jupyter-notebook for plotting elapsed times
* genuine_elapsed_times.csv             
* with_reduction_elapsed_times.csv     Used csv file. It will not be erased if you run tests.
* without_reduction_elapsed_times.csv
